1. Data Collection 
Historical Stock Prices
Approach 1 (Yfinance): Use yfinance to fetch the historical stock prices for the tickers of interest for the entire year of 2023. This method allows for an easy bulk download of Adjusted Close prices, which you've labeled as 'End' in your requirements.

Approach 2 (Alpha Vantage): Use Alpha Vantage for a more detailed approach, especially if you need adjusted daily data that includes dividends and splits adjustments. Remember, some detailed data might require a premium subscription.

EPS Data
Use Alpha Vantage to gather EPS data for all tickers in your list, focusing on 2023 data and filtering for quarterly earnings.

Earnings Date Data
Utilize the confirmed earnings dates CSV file you've mentioned or the API endpoint to gather earnings date information for 2023. Ensure to adjust for effective stock movement dates based on whether the earnings were announced pre-market or post-market.

Options Data and Greeks
Since you've mentioned Polygon.io as a source, you can fetch options data including Calls and Puts at the money for the nearest expiration. This will require using Polygon.io's API.



2. Data Organization and Database Preparation
MySQL Database Setup: Establish a MySQL database where you will store all the fetched data. You'll need tables for historical stock prices, EPS data, earnings dates, and options data.

Data Import: For each data source, write scripts (preferably in Python) to parse the data (if it's not already in a suitable format) and then insert it into the corresponding tables in your MySQL database. This might involve creating CSV files from the data fetched via APIs and then importing these CSV files into MySQL.

SQL Queries: Develop SQL queries to extract the necessary columns from your datasets. This will likely involve JOIN operations to merge data from different tables based on common identifiers (like ticker symbols and dates).

Database Scripting: Wrap these operations in a Python script using libraries like mysql-connector-python or SQLAlchemy to automate the data fetching, processing, and database operations.



3. Action Plan
Data Collection Scripts: Begin by writing Python scripts to collect data from yfinance, Alpha Vantage, the confirmed earnings CSV/API, and Polygon.io. Focus on collecting data for the tickers listed in your options list.

Database Schema Design: Design your MySQL database schema based on the types of data you're collecting. This includes deciding on the tables you need, the columns for each table, and the data types of each column.

Database Connectivity and Data Insertion: Write scripts to connect to your MySQL database and insert the collected data. Make sure to handle exceptions and errors to ensure data integrity.

Data Extraction and Analysis Prep: Once your data is in the database, write SQL queries to extract and combine the data needed for your analysis. This might include merging historical prices with EPS data and earnings dates to analyze stock performance around earnings announcements.

Automation and Maintenance: Ensure your scripts are well-documented and easy to run. Consider setting up a schedule for regular data updates, especially if your analysis needs to be up-to-date or repeated in the future.
